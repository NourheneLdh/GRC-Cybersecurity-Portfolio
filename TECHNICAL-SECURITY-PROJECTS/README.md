# 🔐 TECHNICAL SECURITY PROJECTS

This folder showcases my technical security projects developed with a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) mindset.  
Although my primary focus is GRC Consulting, I believe technical literacy enhances my ability to assess real-world risks, vulnerabilities, and controls more effectively.
